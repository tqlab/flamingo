extended-description = """\
 Flamingo is a high performance peer-to-peer mesh VPN over UDP supporting strong encryption, 
 NAT traversal and a simple configuration. It establishes a fully-meshed self-healing VPN
 network in a peer-to-peer manner with strong end-to-end encryption based on elliptic curve
 keys and AES-256. Flamingo creates a virtual network interface on the host and forwards all
 received data via UDP to the destination. It can work on TUN devices (IP based) and TAP 
 devices (Ethernet based)."""
